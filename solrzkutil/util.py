        timeout - The longest to wait for a Zookeeper connection.
        client_id - A Zookeeper client id, used when re-establishing a prior session connection.
        handler - An instance of a class implementing the IHandler interface for callback handling.
        default_acl - A default ACL used on node creation.
        auth_data - A list of authentication credentials to use for the connection. 
                    Should be a list of (scheme, credential) tuples as add_auth() takes.
        read_only - Allow connections to read only servers.
        randomize_hosts - By default randomize host selection.
        connection_retry - A kazoo.retry.KazooRetry object to use for retrying the connection to 
                           Zookeeper. Also can be a dict of options which will be used for creating one.
        command_retry - A kazoo.retry.KazooRetry object to use for the KazooClient.retry() method. 
                        Also can be a dict of options which will be used for creating one.
        logger - A custom logger to use instead of the module global log instance.
